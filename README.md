I am planning on making some type of Unity Platformer. I don't know if it will be 2D or 3D. If it is 3D, I will make it more of an expoloration game while the 2D will be something akin to Mario. It will have enemies that will try to kill the player while the player must make it somewhere or defeat them all. Ideally, it would be a roguelike where you can upgrade your character on each death so each subsequent playthrough is easier or where you upgrade your character with randomized things throughout he playthrough. However, that will be implemented if I get the base game going already.
