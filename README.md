I was planning on making a unity platformer but Unity refused to install on my computer. So, I made a 2D platformer in Godot instead. There are two enemy types, bat and slime. Bat flies and the slime travels on the ground. You must avoid touching either enemy or you'll be sent back to the start. You can also die by falling off. The objective is to get to the end of the level, climb the ladder and hit the box to complete it.
